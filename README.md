# Shopaholic

## This is a project used for the project defence of the SoftUni Angular course.

Shopaholic uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for storage.


Some of the functionalitues are:
- User register (with e-mail and password or with Google account)
- Basic admin logic for distinguishing users from admins
- Both registered and non-registered users can view the store, but only registered and logged-in users can add a product to the cart
- Not logged-in Users can Register, Login or view the store.
- Logged-in Users can view and edit basic profile info, add a product in their cart and purchase it

Due to the short timeframe for development the projects lacks more advanced logic, but it may be finalized at some time in the future.
